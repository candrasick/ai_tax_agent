Analyze the provided image of a form page. Ignore black text and focus on numeric text rendered in blue.

Step 1: Scan the entire image and locate all text in a distinct blue color.
Step 2: From that blue text, identify which elements are numeric values.  Blue values usually contain commas (e.g., '1,234,567') and are written in a numeric format. Some may be negative or surrounded by parentheses.
Step 3: Estimate each blue amountâ€™s bounding box using image coordinates.
Step 4: Return the full result as a JSON array as shown below.

**Output Format:**
Output ONLY a single JSON list of objects. Each object in the list should represent one piece of blue text and contain:
*   `amount`: The extracted text content (string).
*   `position`: A list of four numbers representing the estimated bounding box `[x0, y0, x1, y1]`.

Example JSON Output:
```json
[
  {{"amount": "1,234,567", "position": [450.5, 100.2, 510.8, 112.0]}},
  {{"amount": "(987)", "position": [451.0, 120.5, 505.0, 132.8]}}
]
```
If no blue text is found, output an empty list `[]`.
